# Automation Framework

This automation framework has been designed specifically for assignment-1 with LexisNexis. It leverages a variety of plugins and dependencies to enable essential functionalities such as report generation, browser loading, and parallel execution. These plugins and dependencies are listed in the `pom.xml` file.

Moreover, the framework facilitates the generation of screenshots for tests when enabled, along with capturing error shots for failed test cases.

## Third Party Libraries/Frameworks

### Cucumber BDD
[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) is a software tool supporting behavior-driven development (BDD) and allows the usage of feature files written using Gherkin syntax.

### Selenium WebDriver
[Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/) is a web framework that enables the automation of browsers to execute actions required during a scenario.

### Extent Report and Extent Spark Report
These reporting plugins utilize the `cucumber.json` generated by Cucumber to produce formatted HTML reports.

- **Extent Report:** Generates HTML reports.
- **Extent Spark Report:** Utilizes the Spark Reports Framework for generating HTML Test Reports.

### WebDriverManager
[WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager/) is a library that automates the management of WebDrivers.

### TestNG
[TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/) is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit, providing various annotations and methods for enabling testing functions.

## Project Structure

Tests are written in Gherkin syntax for use in the Cucumber BDD framework, ensuring accessibility and ease of composition for non-technical stakeholders. These tests are organized as feature files located in the `src/test/java/resources/features` folder.

Feature files utilize step definitions written in Java, found in the `src/test/java/stepdefinitions` folder. These step definitions interact with page elements through page objects, which encapsulate methods for actions like clicking, sending keys, etc. Page class files reside in the `src/test/java/pages` folder.

The entire suite is executed by the runner located at `src/test/java/runner/testNg.java`, where various parameters such as plugins, step definitions, features, and tags for scenario execution are specified.

The Hook, located within the `src/test/java/stepdefinitions/Hooks.java` folder, specifies methods to be executed with each scenario using annotations.

## Pre-requisite Requirements

To use the Automation Framework, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- JDK 1.8+ installed (ensure Java class path is set)
- Maven installed (ensure `.m2` class path is set or use the dependency)
- IntelliJ Plugins installed (ensure TestNG / Gherkin / Cucumber Java plugins are installed)
- Browser driver installed (ensure desired browser like Edge, Firefox, Chrome is installed)

To set up the framework:
- Fork / Clone repository from [here](repository-link) or download the zip and set it up in your local workspace.

## Operating System Compatibility

The framework can run on the following operating systems:
- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux

Additional operating systems may be compatible as needed.

## Hardware Requirements

As a Java-based project, the hardware requirements align with those of Java. Refer to [Java's hardware requirements](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/sysreq.html).

If running via an IDE, ensure the hardware meets the minimum requirements of the chosen IDE. For IntelliJ IDEA, refer to [installation guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html).

## Running the Tests

### Via Maven

Execute `mvn clean install` in a terminal from the root directory of the project. This command ensures the full suite is executed, including test report generation.

### Via IDE

If using IntelliJ IDEA or a similar IDE with Maven integration, execute the suite through the IDE's interface.

## Viewing Test Output

After running the test suite, Cucumber generates a simple JSON output located at `target/jason/file.json`. Additionally, the Extent Report and Extent Spark Report plugins generate HTML reports at:

- **Extent Report:** `test-out/ExtentHtml.html`
- **Extent Spark Report:** `test-output/SparkReport/Spark/Spark.html`
